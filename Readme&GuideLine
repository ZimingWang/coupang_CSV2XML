0.1 This is a simple example to convert the CSV file into xml format.
Basically this is referenced from the example provided by the stackoverflow.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12120055/conversion-of-csv-to-xml-with-java

0.2 There are two implemented method and the first is just read and parse without imported other
tools. And the second way applied csvreader from opencsv.

0.3 The first implemented way is just show result in the console and would not be written into 
the xml file.



0.4To see the result, please read the files in csv and xml folder of the testSource folder. 
To test the reuslt cases, please execute the java files in the TestExample package



1.we assume that all the csv files  used unified delimeter, but the delimeter could be optional
The test cases is coming from the 	https://github.com/dralagen/csv2xml
	

2. when the csv may be large, then it would be better to pre-process of it to split it into smaller
part, or apply map-reduce method to parse separate part.Also the resource xml file should also 
be considered, for example, if read and parse xml file involved,then the SAX is more suitable
than DOM to be applied.


	
3.If these should be put into reality use as products
then 
3.1 it may needed to be put as much functions as possible, not only the csv to xml,
but the xml to csv, and other format like pure text and json should also be considered.

3.2 we should customized the feature of resource file and result file to make it common used.

3.3 publish it in the webservice and provide the api or put it into app.

3.4 team work needed, then managable tools and continues integeration tools should be imported.
